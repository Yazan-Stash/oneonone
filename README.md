# Oneonone (One-on-One)
This is a demo toy app, that I'll be using to record a series of videos on the basics of writing modern REST APIs, I'll update this readme with the series url once it's published.

The main idea of the app is to have a place where team leaders can record memos of one-on-ones with their team members.

## Requirements
[ ] There's two kind of users we can onboard, team "Leaders" and "Members".
[ ] A team leader can lead multiple members.
[ ] A member is led by only one leader.
[ ] A leader can see a list of memos he has previously posted.
[ ] A leader can view a specific memo.
[ ] A leader can post One-On-One memo for a member.
[ ] A leader can update a memo.
[ ] A leader can delete a memo.
[ ] A member can see a list of memos shared with him.
[ ] A member can view a specific memo shared with him.
[ ] A leader can only see/(act on) his memos.
[ ] A member can only see memos shared with him.
[ ] When a leader creates a memo, notify the member.
[ ] When a leader updates a memo, notify the member.
[ ] New users should receive a welcome email on their first login.
